We do not encourage pushing your personal development work to the Udacity's starter repository. Therefore, we've decided to archive this repository. However, learners will be able to fork it to their personal Github account but cannot submit PRs to this repository. If you have any issues or suggestions to make, feel free to:\r - Utilize the https://knowledge.udacity.com/ forum to seek help on content-specific issues.\r - Submit a support ticket along with the link to your forked repository if (learners are) blocked for other reasons. You can find the link to file a support ticket in your classroom home.",
